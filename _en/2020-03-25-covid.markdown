description: |
  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many websites of vital importance are
  down because they cannot withstand the intensified traffic mass
  thereby.  Given these circumstances, static websites are useful due to
  their resilience and accessibility.  You can count on Sutty to publish
  (or rework extant resources into) solidary and resistent websites!
